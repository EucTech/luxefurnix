# Luxefurnix E-commerce - Buy your luxurious furrnitures

Luxefurnix(Redefining Furniture Elegance and Comfort) is an E-commerce web application for quality furniture. It is built to solve the challenge of connecting furniture producers with customers seeking luxurious and cozy furniture. The project provides an online marketplace where customers can browse and purchase high-quality furniture. Additionally, it ensures a seamless transaction process where the purchased product is promptly delivered within 24 hours after payment. The use of an Escrow system guarantees a secure transaction: when the customer pays, the money is held in Escrow until the product is received and approved by the customer, at which point the funds are released to the producer.


The Frontend
Luxefurnix Frontend uses majorly HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, when you enter the site's url into your browser, it brings you primary to the landing page which has the logo, a button for search, the home route, a route for sellers, a route for buyers, and a route to sign up or log in depending on if you are a first time user or returning User.

In the home route, basically the main landing page, you will get to see some sample furniture from some companies displayed, the various categories displayed, about the company, how to contact the company and basically all the main things that are necessary

The route that says SELL, is basically for the companies who deal in furniture, on that route they will create an account or profile for their company following luxefurnix's regulations and if they meet all requirements, they can begin to uplosd their products for sell with the prices

The route that says ORDER is basically for users(BUYERS) who come to luxefurnix to look for furniture from various companies based on their location, they will sign up and be able to have access to all available products in their location of choice, and be able to add a product to cart if the product description and price catches their attention

The sign up area for users basically has a section for name, email address, phone number and password, then another to verify the password, after the information is correctly filled, the User will be registered to our database and subsequently only have to log in.

The log in area is for returning users each time they need to use the site, it is important to create an account so they can have their previous activity saved (for example adding things to cart and only paying for them in the next navigation). The log in option takes just the email address and password

When someone sees a product that catches their eye, they can click on it and see a full description of the product, price, information about the company selling the product and reviews from other people about that product, seeing all that will cause them to make an informed decision of whether they want to buy it or not
If they decide to add it to cart, it will show in their shopping cart, which they can go forward to order or remove from cart if they change their mind.
